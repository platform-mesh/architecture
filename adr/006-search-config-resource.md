# ADR 006: SearchConfig Resource for Provider-Defined Field Indexing

| Status  | Proposed   |
|---------|------------|
| Date    | 2026-04-30 |

## Context and Problem Statement

The search-operator (RFC-003) currently auto-populates field classification on `SearchIndex` resources by reading the `APIResourceSchema` and applying heuristics: all top-level fields become `defaultFields`, all `string`-typed fields become `semanticFields`, and all scalar-typed fields become `filterableFields`. This one-size-fits-all approach has several problems:

1. **Providers have no control over indexing behavior.** A provider that exposes large text blobs (e.g., base64-encoded certificates, raw JSON payloads) has those fields indexed as semantic — wasting vector storage and degrading search quality.
2. **No way to exclude fields.** Internal identifiers, secrets, or denormalized cache fields are indexed even when they provide no search value.
3. **Heuristics cannot capture domain intent.** Only the provider team knows that `spec.displayName` is semantically meaningful while `spec.internalRef` is an opaque ID useful only for exact-match filtering.
4. **No service contract between provider and search.** If a provider changes its schema, the search behavior changes silently. There is no explicit declaration of indexing intent.

RFC-004 ("Everything is a Provider") establishes that providers should own their configuration and expose it via APIExports. The search provider's field classification should follow this model: the **resource provider** declares how its fields should be indexed, and the search-operator honors that declaration.

## Decision Drivers

* **Provider autonomy**: Providers must control how their resources appear in search without requiring search-operator code changes.
* **Explicit over implicit**: Field classification should be declared, not inferred.
* **Service contract**: The SearchConfig acts as a contract between the resource provider and the search provider.
* **Co-location**: Configuration lives alongside the APIResourceSchema it describes, in the provider workspace.
* **Backwards compatibility**: Providers that do not supply a SearchConfig get the current auto-populated behavior (heuristic fallback).

## Decision

Introduce a new `SearchConfig` APIResourceSchema (`search.platform-mesh.io/v1alpha1`) that resource providers create in their provider workspace to declare per-APIResourceSchema field indexing behavior.

### SearchConfig Resource Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: search.platform-mesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: SearchConfig
metadata:
  name: accounts.core.platform-mesh.io  # matches the APIResourceSchema name
spec:
  # Reference to the APIResourceSchema this config applies to
  apiResourceSchemaRef:
    name: accounts.core.platform-mesh.io

  # Fields that should NOT be indexed at all (excluded from defaultFields, semantic, and filterable)
  excludedFields:
    - spec.internalCacheJSON
    - spec.certificateBundle
    - status.reconciledGeneration

  # Fields that should be indexed for semantic/vector search
  # These are typically human-readable text fields where meaning matters
  semanticFields:
    - spec.displayName
    - spec.description
    - spec.tags

  # Fields that should be indexed as exact-match (keyword) for filtering/faceting
  # These are typically identifiers, enums, or structured values
  exactFields:
    - spec.region
    - spec.tier
    - status.phase
    - metadata.labels

status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
    - type: SchemaValid
      status: "True"
      message: "All referenced fields exist in APIResourceSchema"
```

### Field Classification Priority

When the search-operator builds the `SearchIndex` field lists, it applies this priority:

1. **excludedFields**: removed from all index field lists. Never indexed.
2. **exactFields**: indexed as `keyword` type only. Not full-text, not semantic.
3. **semanticFields**: indexed as `semantic` type (vector embeddings). Also included in full-text.

This means a provider only needs to declare the **exceptions** to the default full-text behavior.

### Where SearchConfig Lives

```
:root:providers:<provider-name>
├── APIExport: <provider>.platform-mesh.io
├── APIResourceSchema: widgets.acme.example.io    ← defines the resource fields
└── SearchConfig: widgets.acme.example.io         ← declares how those fields are indexed
```

The SearchConfig resource is stored in the **provider workspace**, alongside the APIResourceSchema it configures. This follows the pattern established in RFC-004 where provider configuration is co-located with provider resources.

### How the Search-Operator Reads SearchConfig

The `APIBindingReconciler` is extended with a new step:

```
APIBinding reaches Bound phase in consumer workspace
  │
  ▼
1. Resolve provider workspace (binding.Status.APIExportClusterName)
  │
  ▼
2. For each bound resource, fetch APIResourceSchema from provider workspace
  │
  ▼
3. NEW: Check if a SearchConfig exists in provider workspace
   with name matching the APIResourceSchema name
  │
  ├── SearchConfig EXISTS → use declared field classification
  │     • excludedFields → remove from all lists
  │     • semanticFields → SearchIndex.spec.semanticFields
  │     • exactFields → SearchIndex.spec.filterableFields
  │
  ├── SearchConfig DOES NOT EXIST → index every fields as defaultField
  │
  ▼
4. Create/update SearchIndex in org workspace (unchanged)
```

### KCP Workspace Topology & Dependencies

```
:root
├── :providers
│   ├── :search                          ← Search provider (owns SearchConfig APIResourceSchema)
│   │   ├── APIExport: search.platform-mesh.io
│   │   │   └── permissionClaims: [accounts, searchindexes, searchconfigs, ...]
│   │   └── APIResourceSchema: searchconfigs.search.platform-mesh.io
│   │
│   ├── :core                            ← Core provider (produces SearchConfig for its resources)
│   │   ├── APIExport: core.platform-mesh.io
│   │   ├── APIResourceSchema: accounts.core.platform-mesh.io
│   │   └── SearchConfig: accounts.core.platform-mesh.io  ← "index my fields like this"
│   │
│   └── :acme                            ← 3rd-party provider
│       ├── APIExport: acme.example.io
│       ├── APIResourceSchema: widgets.acme.example.io
│       └── SearchConfig: widgets.acme.example.io
│
├── :orgs
│   └── :acme-org (cluster: org-123)
│       ├── SearchIndex: pm-org-123-accounts     ← fields derived from SearchConfig
│       ├── SearchIndex: pm-org-123-widgets      ← fields derived from SearchConfig
│       │
│       └── :dev-team (account workspace)
│           ├── APIBinding → core.platform-mesh.io
│           ├── APIBinding → acme.example.io
│           └── Account / Widget resources (indexed per SearchIndex config)
│
└── :platform-mesh-system
```

**Dependency flow:**

```
Provider creates SearchConfig ──► search-operator reads it ──► SearchIndex spec populated ──► OpenSearch mapping created
         (provider ws)                  (via provider client)        (org workspace)              (OpenSearch cluster)
```

### Permission Claims

The search-operator's APIExport must add a permission claim for `searchconfigs`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apis.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIExport
metadata:
  name: search.platform-mesh.io
spec:
  permissionClaims:
    - group: search.platform-mesh.io
      resource: searchconfigs
      all: true    # read SearchConfig from all provider workspaces
    # ... existing claims
```

### Validation

The search-operator validates SearchConfig on read:

1. **Schema cross-reference**: All field paths in `excludedFields`, `semanticFields`, and `exactFields` must exist in the referenced APIResourceSchema. If a field is referenced but does not exist, set `status.conditions[SchemaValid]=False`.
2. **No overlap**: A field cannot appear in more than one list. If overlap is detected, the highest-priority list wins (`excludedFields` > `exactFields` > `semanticFields`).
3. **Semantic field type check**: Fields listed in `semanticFields` should be of type `string` in the schema. Non-string fields in semanticFields produce a warning condition.

## Consequences

* Good, because providers gain explicit control over how their resources are indexed without search-operator code changes.
* Good, because the SearchConfig acts as a versioned, auditable service contract between resource providers and the search platform.
* Good, because excluding sensitive or large fields prevents index bloat and protects data that should not be searchable.
* Good, because the heuristic fallback ensures backwards compatibility — no provider is forced to create a SearchConfig.
* Good, because SearchConfig is co-located with the APIResourceSchema it describes, making consistency easy to maintain.
* Bad, because providers must now maintain an additional resource alongside their APIResourceSchema.
* Bad, because the search-operator now reads from provider workspaces (additional cross-workspace client), increasing reconciliation complexity.
* Bad, because schema changes in APIResourceSchema may invalidate SearchConfig field references, requiring providers to keep them in sync.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Annotations on APIResourceSchema fields

Encode indexing hints as annotations directly on the APIResourceSchema OpenAPI schema (e.g., `x-search-semantic: true`). Rejected because:
- KCP does not support custom extensions in APIResourceSchema validation schemas
- Mixes concerns (API definition vs. search configuration)
- Not discoverable or auditable as a standalone resource

### 2. SearchIndex-level overrides by org admins

Allow org admins to override field classification on the SearchIndex in their org workspace. Rejected because:
- Org admins lack domain knowledge about which fields are semantically meaningful
- Creates drift between organizations consuming the same provider
- Does not establish a service contract

### 3. Configuration in the search-operator environment variables

Extend `SEARCHABLE_RESOURCE_RESOURCES` env var format to include field config. Rejected because:
- Requires search-operator redeployment for any field change
- Not provider-self-service
- Does not scale with number of providers
